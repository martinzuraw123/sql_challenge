In this module as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, your first major task is to conduct a research project on employees from the 1980s and 1990s using the available CSV files. Your project involves designing tables to store CSV data, importing it into a SQL database, and performing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. First, inspect the CSV files and sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables. Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Verify that primary keys are unique or create composite keys if necessary. Create tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table. Import data in the same order as the corresponding tables were created. Account for headers during imports. For your data analysis make sure 
List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
List the first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
List the manager of each department with department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
List the department number for each employee with employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List the first name, last name, and sex of each employee named Hercules with a last name starting with the letter B.
List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all employee last names (i.e., how many employees share each last name).
Before submitting your Challenge assignment, make sure that youâ€™ve done the following:
Create an image file of your ERD.
Create a .sql file of your table schemata.
Create a .sql file of your queries.
